# Trivia

## What is this?

This is a Trivia game made by Maor, Gil, Niv.\
Each question is chosen at random (read below for more info) and all of the parameters of the questions are unique, this ensure hard yet rewarding questions!

## Randomization

Each question is generated on-demand which allows it to have some unique features.\
There are three types of questions being displayed in a cycle, the first two are\
randomized whilst the last question is from a database of rated questions.

## Rating system

As mentioned above, the third question in a cycle will be received from a database containing rated questions, the higher the rating of the question - the higher the probability of it being shown. \
Each question can be rated multiple times which allow its overall average rating to be \
changed and modified the longer people play the game and rate questions.

## Leaderboard

The user will be required to enter a name which earn points for each correct question,\
this name will then be used to display the user in a leaderboard which is being saved in\
the database as well.\
The scores will be arranged from the highest to the lowest.
